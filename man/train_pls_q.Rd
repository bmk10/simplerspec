\title{Train a PLS regression model
(quoted version of the function)}
\usage{
train_pls_q(x, evaluation_method = "test_resampling", response, tr_control,
  env = parent.frame(), pls_ncomp_max = 20, ncomp_fixed = 5, center,
  scale, tuning_method = "resampling")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List that contains calibration
set, validation set, and model tuning options}

\item{response}{Response variable to be modeled}

\item{tr_control}{Object that defines controlling parameters
of the desired internal validation framework}

\item{env}{Environment where function is evaluated}

\item{validation}{Logical expression weather independent
validation is performed}
}
\description{
Uses the caret package to perform PLS modeling.
Spectra are centered and scaled prior to modeling.
