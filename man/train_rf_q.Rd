\title{Fit a random forest model
(quoted version of the function)}
\usage{
train_rf_q(x, validation = TRUE, evaluation_method = "resampling", response,
  tr_control, ntree_max = 500, env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List that contains calibration
set, validation set, and model tuning options}

\item{validation}{Logical expression weather independent
validation is performed}

\item{response}{Response variable to be modeled}

\item{tr_control}{Object that defines controlling parameters
of the desired internal validation framework}

\item{env}{Environment where function is evaluated}
}
\description{
Uses the caret package to perform random forest
modeling.
Spectra are centered and scaled prior to modeling.
